## [Skope-rules](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skope-rules) 
Python machine learning module built on top of scikit-learn and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. Skope-rules aims at learning logical, interpretable rules for "scoping" a target class, i.e. detecting with high precision instances of this class. Skope-rules is a trade off between the interpretability of a Decision Tree and the modelization power of a Random Forest.
